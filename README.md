# Background
In order to answer the questions below, which helped job seekers and fresh graduates understand which skills they can use to advance their careers along with some good salaries, I first collected this data from the internet as a.CSV files  and then imported it into the vs code. To put it briefly, we were driven by a quest to navigate the data analyst job market more effectively, this project was born from a desire to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand skills, streamlining others work to find optimal jobs.
The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:  

1.What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?  
2.What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?  
3.What skills are most in demand for data analysts?  
4.Which skills are associated with higher salaries?  
5.What are the most optimal skills to learn?  
# Tools I Used
Here are all the tools on which i gained the hands on experience through this project and able to find results:  
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools like:

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.  
- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.  
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.  
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.  
# My Analysis 
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Hereâ€™s how I approached each question:  

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs  
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```SQL 
--Here we are going to find the top salaries jobs which are remotely located 
--By using CTE
SELECT
    *
FROM(
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    name AS Company,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN
    company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE 
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND    
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND 
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY    
    salary_year_avg DESC
Limit 10
) AS Top10
Limit 10
OFFSET 5;
--Successfully find the result
```
Here's the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs in 2023:
